# TEAM MEMBER ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITY #

The development of Equation Defender was a group effort where each member took on a 
specific role to make the game look good, work correctly, and teach math effectively.
The team consist of Benjamin Parinas, Laurence Meniano, and Jerby Calo that worked together
to turn a math subject into a fun 3D space adventure.

1. Laurence Meniano: Technical Lead & System Architect
    -served as the primary architect for the game's core engine and 3D environment.
    His role focused on the high-level technical framework that allows for real-time
    interaction in a browser environment.

    Scene Architecture:
    Managed the initialization of the Three.js scene, including the configuration of the
    perspective camera and the hardware-accelerated WebGL renderer.

    Starfield Engineering:
    Developed the advanced multi-layer parallax starfield, implementing the procedural
    expansion algorithm that creates the illusion of infinite space.

    Performance Optimization:
    Oversaw memory management strategies, ensuring the explicit disposal of geometries
    and materials to maintain a target of 60 FPS on modern hardware.

2. Benjamin Parinas: Game Logic & Mathematical Integrator
    -responsible for the gameplay mechanics and the integration of the educational curriculum. 
    His role ensured that the game remained a viable learning tool while maintaining arcade-style
    engagement.

    Targeting Systems: 
    Developed the nearest-neighbor matching algorithm and fuzzy matching logic
    (0.01 threshold) to validate player inputs against active equations.

    Level Design:
    Structured the three-tier progression system, balancing mathematical complexity
    (Arithmetic, Algebra, and Advanced Math) with decreasing temporal constraints to 
    maintain a "flow" state.

    Data Management:
    Implemented the CSV-based storage system using PapaParse, allowing for the organized 
    retrieval and validation of mathematical payloads.

3. Jerby Calo: Creative Lead & UI/UX Designer
    -directed the visual identity and sensory experience of the project. His work focused 
    on the "Retro-Futuristic" aesthetic and ensuring that the user interface was both 
    functional and visually stunning.

    Visual Design System: 
    Defined the "Cyber-Grid" color palette (Cyan and Magenta) and 
    typography (Orbitron and Courier New) to evoke a classic 1980s terminal feel.

    Asset Pipeline: 
    Managed the GLB model loading process and material enhancement pipeline, 
    ensuring that 3D assets reacted correctly to the scene's complex lighting.

    Sensory Feedback: 
    Integrated the HTML5 Audio API to synchronize background music and laser sound 
    effects with gameplay events, providing immediate auditory feedback for correct answers.
